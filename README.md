Instructions

Run the Algorithm1.cpp as follows
1->g++ -std=c++17 -O2 filename.cpp -o filename
2->./filename input.txt h

Note here input file you have to give in the terminal and also the h
value you have to give in the terminal
Run the Algorithm4.cpp as follows
1->g++ -std=c++17 -O2 filename.cpp -o filename
2->./filename

In this code already contain the input.txt dataset case just change
the dataset name there
Then you will be asked for the h value
